Overview
========
This directory contains the translation tables for converting
character codes to font codes in the LCD/OLED character displays.
The LCD controller is the HD44780U which has three code pages
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitachi_HD44780_LCD_controller

All translation tables have three variables
name  - The language name of the table to check against language parameter in /etc/radiod.conf
controller - Controller type HD44780U (Default) or HD44780 (Older LCDs). 
codepage - The codepage in hex which matches the codes in the table to the font location in the LCD
codes -	The translation codes for the native alphabet such as Russian Cyrillic
romanized - Translation codes to convert native alphabet to romanized(latin) characters

All translation tables are processed by the translate class (translate_class.py)
The first one that is processed is the one the matches the language parameter in /etc/radiod.conf
All other tables are processed in turn using their romanized codes
The English translation table is always processed last agin using irs romanized codes..

The following parameters /etc/radiod.conf are of importance (shown with defaults)
romanize=true	# Use romanize table else use the native codes table
codepage=0	# Select LCD font page. Ussually 0 but depending upon the device can 1, 2.
language=English	# The default language
translate_lcd=on	# Setting this to off disables all radiod translation routines

The behaviour of the table matching the language statement is influenced by a number of factors.
If the romanize parameter in /etc/radiod.conf is set to false, its codes table will be used to
map onto the font table of the LCD.
 
Adding new font tables
======================
Copy an existing table to a table with a name matching the language, for example Greek
cp Russian.py to Greek.py
Change the character codes and font codes to match the language and LCD font
For example:
	'\\xd0\\xa4' : chr(0xaa),       # Ð¤
You will need a copy of the LCD controller specification which contains the code charts to do this
